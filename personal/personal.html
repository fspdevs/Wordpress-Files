        <td>
          Financial companies collect and sometimes share personal
          information to underwrite funding services and prevent
          fraudulent activities on accounts. While Federal law gives
          consumers the right to limit some sharing, these laws don’t
          always extend to business transactions. This notice should help
          you to understand what we do.

          The types of information we collect and share in processing
          &amp; underwriting depends on the level of funding and service

          <p>
            Federal law applies to consumer, not business transactions,
            and gives you the right to limit only:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              sharing for affiliates&#39; everyday consumer account

          State laws and individual companies may give you additional
          rights to limit sharing. See below for more on your rights under
          state law.

          Any person listed on an application for business funding agrees
          that they are doing so as a member/officer of the business.
