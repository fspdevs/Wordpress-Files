          <h2>Factor Rates</h2>
          <p class="p-terms">
            By visiting our website, you’re likely looking for a financial
            funding solution to grow your business or address a challenge that
            arises. As an informed business owner, you should weigh the
            options of what type of business funding to choose, and what type
            of interest comes with that choice. Any funding your business
            receives, whether it be from a loan or Merchant Cash Advance (MCA)
            comes with a cost to finance. Because of their consumer
            experiences with mortgages, car purchases, etc.; many are familiar
            with the term annual percentage rate (APR), a figure commonly
            associated with credit cards and other consumer funding options.
            However, if you choose the quicker MCA type of funding to fulfill
            your business needs, the cost of financing comes in the form of a
            factor rate. As many may not be familiar with Factor Rates, we at
            Par Funding want to help you understand the
            difference so you can make an informed choice that will best help
            your business.
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <p class="p-terms">
            First, interest rates like APRs are associated with loans. Factor
            Rates are associated with Merchant Cash Advances (MCAs). As
            opposed to lending you money, MCAs purchase (or “Factor”) future
            receivables based on an evaluation of your business receipts. With
            an interest rate (APR) on a loan, your payments can actually have
            a moving target because the rate will be recalculated over the
            course of your financing, based on the depreciating capital in an
            unpredictable market-based economy.
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <p class="p-terms">
            On the other hand, factor rates are based on your receivables,
            calculated up front and never change. Rather than make recurring
            payments as you would with a standard loan, you’ll pay the full
            amount disclosed up front in a pre-disclosed payment plan that’s
            automatically drafted though ACH drafts.

            <strong>
              Understanding the differences between Factor Rates (Merchant
              Cash Advances) and APRs (Loans):
            </strong>
            <div class="contact-wrap">
              <ul >
                <li>
                  <strong>They are different types of transactions.</strong>
                  Annual Percentage Rates (APR) are percentages that determine
                  the annual rate of interest a business owner is charged for
                  borrowed capital. The calculation is typically close to the
                  prime rate set by markets. On the other hand, factor rates
                  are most commonly represented as a fixed decimal number
                  which determines the total amount of capital that business
                  owners are obligated to pay upon the sale of a fixed period
                  of their future receivables.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>
                    Factor rates are typically associated with merchant cash
                    advances (MCAs).
                  </strong>
                  MCAs differ from small business loans as they are a fixed
                  sale of receivables, and not a loan. Similar to an APR,
                  Factor rates are calculated as decimals ranging from 1.1 to
                  1.5. If you multiply your factor rate by the amount of
                  future receivables you sold for the MCA, you can arrive at
                  the factor rate. So, if you receive an MCA of $100,000 with
                  a 1.25 factor rate, you’ll have sold $125,000 in future
                  receivables by the end of the payment period.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>How it differs from Loans and APR.</strong> Loans
                  operate differently from cash advances in that you’ll pay
                  different amounts as you pay back the loan (principal vs.
                  interest). APR also enters all of the miscellaneous,
                  unforeseen, tangential costs of a loan into the equation. In
                  layman’s terms, the APR is the rate you’ll actually have to
                  pay on a loan in order to borrow money. So if your given
                  rate is five percent, your APR might be 5.5 – 5.8%,
                  depending on other cost factors by the time you sign your
                  contract.
